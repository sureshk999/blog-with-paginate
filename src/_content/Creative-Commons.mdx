# Understanding Creative Commons: A Guide to Open Licensing

3.  **CC BY-ND (Attribution-NoDerivs)**: Allows for redistribution, commercial and non-commercial, as long as the work is passed along unchanged and in whole, with credit to you.
4.  **CC BY-NC (Attribution-NonCommercial)**: Others can remix, tweak, and build upon your work non-commercially, and although their new works must also acknowledge you and be non-commercial, they don’t have to license their derivative works on the same terms.
5.  **CC BY-NC-SA (Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike)**: Others can remix, tweak, and build upon your work non-commercially, as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms.
6.  **CC BY-NC-ND (Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs)**: Allows others to download your works and share them with others as long as they credit you, but they can’t change them in any way or use them commercially.
